# Image Pipeline & Gallery System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Filename Normalization
- ✅ Created `scripts/normalize-filenames.mjs`:
  - Removes spaces and special characters from filenames
  - Converts to lowercase slug format
  - Generates `public/redirects.json` with old → new path mappings
  - Preserves file extensions

### 2. Comprehensive Image Manifest
- ✅ Created `scripts/build-images-all.mjs`:
  - Scans entire `public/` directory recursively
  - Processes PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, AVIF, GIF, SVG
  - Generates WebP and AVIF variants
  - Extracts dominant colors
  - Creates blur placeholders
  - Outputs to `src/data/images.manifest.json`

### 3. Dataset Generation
- ✅ Created `scripts/build-datasets.mjs`:
  - Extracts demos from `demos/` folder
  - Extracts gallery items from `images/` folder
  - Generates `src/data/demos.json` and `src/data/gallery.json`
  - Includes metadata and slugs

### 4. Production Components
- ✅ Created `ImageLightbox` component:
  - Click to open full-screen view
  - Keyboard support (ESC to close)
  - Click outside to close
  - Prevents body scroll when open
  - Accessible with ARIA labels

- ✅ Created `DemoCard` component:
  - Displays demo thumbnails
  - Ambient glow from dominant color
  - Hover effects
  - Links to demo pages

- ✅ Created `GalleryGrid` component:
  - Responsive grid layout
  - Uses ImageLightbox for viewing
  - Optimized image loading

### 5. Pages
- ✅ Created `src/pages/Demos.tsx`:
  - Lists all interactive demos
  - Uses DemoCard components
  - Responsive grid layout

- ✅ Created `src/pages/Gallery.tsx`:
  - Displays "From the Work" gallery
  - Uses GalleryGrid component
  - Lightbox viewing

### 6. Navigation & Routing
- ✅ Added "Demos" link to Tools/Skills submenu
- ✅ Added route for `/demos` in AppRouter
- ✅ Gallery route already existed, now uses new component

### 7. Package Scripts
- ✅ Added scripts to `package.json`:
  - `images:normalize` - Normalize filenames
  - `images:build:all` - Build comprehensive manifest
  - `datasets:build` - Generate demos and gallery datasets
  - `images:all` - Run all image processing steps

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Run Image Pipeline
Execute the full pipeline to normalize filenames, build manifest, and generate datasets:

```bash
npm run images:all
```

This will:
1. Normalize all filenames in `public/` (removes spaces, special chars)
2. Build comprehensive image manifest
3. Generate demos.json and gallery.json datasets

**Note**: The normalize script will rename files. Review `public/redirects.json` after running to see what changed.

### 2. Update Hard-coded Paths
After normalization, update any hard-coded image paths in:
- Case study data files
- Component imports
- Content files
- Any references to old filenames

Check `public/redirects.json` for the mapping of old → new paths.

### 3. Wire Thumbnails to Case Studies
Update case study data to include thumbnail paths. For example:

```typescript
// In src/data/caseStudies.ts or case study data files
{
  slug: 'the-launchpad',
  title: 'The Launchpad',
  thumbnail: 'demos/graston-growth-engine.jpg', // Add this
  // ... other props
}
```

### 4. Test Components
- Visit `/demos` to see demo cards
- Visit `/gallery` to see gallery grid
- Test lightbox functionality
- Verify image optimization is working

### 5. Add Hero Images
For case study pages, add hero images using the HeroMedia component:

```tsx
import HeroMedia from '@components/case-study/HeroMedia';
import { useDominantTheme } from '@hooks/useDominantTheme';

// In component:
useDominantTheme('demos/graston-growth-engine.jpg');

// In JSX:
<HeroMedia src="demos/graston-growth-engine.jpg" alt="Case study hero" />
```

## 🎨 Features

### Image Optimization
- Automatic WebP/AVIF generation
- Blur-up placeholders
- Dominant color extraction
- Aspect-ratio preservation

### Dynamic Theming
- Cards use dominant colors for ambient glow
- Case study pages can be themed from hero images
- CSS variable `--case-glow` for dynamic theming

### Gallery System
- Lightbox viewing with keyboard support
- Responsive grid layouts
- Optimized image loading
- Accessible components

## 📝 Notes

- **Filename Normalization**: Files with spaces will be renamed (e.g., `Screenshot of App.jpg` → `screenshot-of-app.jpg`)
- **Redirects**: `public/redirects.json` contains the mapping for updating references
- **Manifest**: All images are indexed in `src/data/images.manifest.json`
- **Datasets**: Demos and gallery items are extracted automatically
- **Components**: All components handle missing data gracefully

## 🔧 Dependencies

Required packages (should already be installed):
- `sharp` - Image processing
- `fs/promises` - File system operations (Node.js built-in)
