 * Visual test scaffold for Storybook components

 * - Run Puppeteer to capture screenshots of Storybook stories
 * - Use pixelmatch for visual diff comparison
 * - Generate visual regression test reports
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/visual-test.js
 *
 * Future implementation:
 *   - Install puppeteer and pixelmatch dependencies
 *   - Configure Storybook build output path
 *   - Capture screenshots of each story variant
 *   - Compare against baseline images
 *   - Generate diff reports
