Los York developed a commanding identity for Eyeline, Netflix’s VFX partner, marking its strategic evolution. The core concept—the pixel as the fundamental building block—underpins a modular, grid-based visual system that scales from micro detail to expansive expression. A thoughtful RGB palette distinguishes divisions, while a refined typographic pairing of Garamond and Netflix Sans balances cinematic legacy with digital innovation. This design-forward approach elevates Eyeline's vision for filmmakers and talent.
