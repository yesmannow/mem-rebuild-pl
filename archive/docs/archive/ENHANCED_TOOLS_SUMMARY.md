Create `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Use Enhanced Extraction

```bash
# Extract comprehensive brand data
node scripts/examples/enhanced-extraction-example.js
```

### Step 4: Integrate Learning Components

```tsx
import { BrandQuiz, LearningPath, BrandComparisonInsights } from './components/inspiration/LearningComponents';

// In your BrandDetailModal or Inspiration page:
<BrandQuiz brandId="nasa-manual" quizData={brand.quiz} />
<LearningPath brandId="nasa-manual" />
<BrandComparisonInsights comparison={comparisonData} />
```
