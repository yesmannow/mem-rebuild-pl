For Eyeline, Netflix's premiere VFX partner, we engineered a dynamic brand identity reflecting its evolution. The core concept centers on the pixel as an elemental building block, unlocking limitless visual potential. A modular, grid-based system unifies its VFX, Studios, and Labs divisions through an RGB color strategy. Typographic tension between a cinematic serif and modern sans articulates the seamless blend of artistry and engineering, establishing a sophisticated presence beyond industry clichés.

Eyeline, a pioneering force at the intersection of visual effects, studio production, and experimental technology, faced a critical branding challenge: unifying its three distinct divisions under a single, cohesive identity. The goal was to project a forward-looking vision that transcended typical VFX clichés, emphasizing artistic craft and inventive spirit, while operating at a global scale akin to their partner, Netflix. The new identity needed to communicate Eyeline’s unique position where cutting-edge engineering meets boundless imagination, honoring its legacy while defining its future.

Los York answered this complex brief with a deceptively simple yet profoundly powerful concept: the pixel as origin. This foundational idea – the smallest unit of vision, a single spark unlocking infinite potential – served as a perfect metaphor for Eyeline’s work, where technology and creativity are inextricably linked. From this core, a modular and expressive design language unfolded, establishing a shared graphic DNA. Each division then found its unique voice through color: red for Studios, green for VFX, and blue for Labs. Together, these form a complete RGB spectrum, a sophisticated nod to image-making's elemental building blocks, providing distinction within coherence.

The pixel concept evolved into a dynamic, grid-based system, capable of infinite expansion from micro to macro, mirroring Eyeline’s collaborative and adaptable creative process. Typography further reinforced this duality, pairing the cinematic warmth of ITC Garamond Light Narrow with the technical precision and contemporary edge of Netflix Sans. This deliberate contrast symbolizes the brand's core tension: imagination meets engineering, grounding the identity in filmmaking legacy while embracing a forward-facing digital ethos. Crucially, the identity actively eschews the often-flashy aesthetics of the VFX industry, opting instead for a clean, confident frame that allows Eyeline's extraordinary craft to take center stage. The result is an aesthetic that is cinematic yet minimal, expressive yet restrained, designed to showcase thinking over mere technique.

The new identity has been met with widespread acclaim, both internally and across the industry. Eyeline’s leadership lauded Los York for capturing the company's spirit and future trajectory, with CEO Jeffrey Shapiro expressing how it perfectly encapsulated "who we are and where we are headed." This sentiment was echoed by Head of Studios Kevin Baillie, who highlighted the overwhelmingly positive feedback from peers. Ultimately, the project's success lies in its ability to elegantly bridge legacy with innovation, transforming Eyeline into a brand truly defined by imagination—a testament to how every pixel, every design decision, reinforces an ethos where technology fuels limitless possibility.
