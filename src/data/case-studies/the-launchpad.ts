  challenge: `Practitioners valued being listed, but the experience didn't produce results. There was no acquisition funnel, no lead routing, no profile analytics, and no lifecycle touchpoints to nurture prospects. The brand was respected — but the system behind it created stagnation instead of momentum.`,

  strategy: `I reframed the product from "a directory" to a growth enablement platform.

Instead of thinking: How do we display providers?

We asked: How do we create ongoing referral velocity?

Key principles guided the rebuild:

- Make every provider visible to the right audience at the right moment
- Give practitioners real performance signals, not vanity stats
- Build an automated lifecycle engine, not a one-time listing`,

  whatIBuilt: `- Outcome-based practitioner profile architecture
- Lead capture with clear attribution and consent
- Automated lead-to-booking lifecycle sequences
- Dashboard for visibility, performance, and referral analytics
- Revenue tiering model and upgrade path`,

  outcomes: `The directory had trust, traffic, and goodwill — but it couldn't convert any of that into measurable business outcomes. Listings looked polished, yet practitioners couldn't see whether visibility was turning into referrals, conversations, or new patients. The platform was passive when it needed to be active.`,
